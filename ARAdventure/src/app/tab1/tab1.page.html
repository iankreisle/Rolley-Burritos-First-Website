      <p>"Hello? Master Garrald? Are you- ...wait. Shoot, you're not my master. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... nevermind.
      My name is Seanerry, and I need your help. I don't know who you are, but right now you're the only help I have. I'm a wizard and...
      well, I'm still an apprentice, but I know some magic, and while I was training I accidentally messed up my teleportation spell
      and I'm some place really dark and I don't know what to do! I don't think I can contact my master. I could really use your help."</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>"It's so dark here. I can't see anything. The ground feels really rough and rocky, and it's a bit damp. I might be able to
      light up the room with a spell, but I don't know if I should save my magic. I might be able to find my way out by feeling the wall,
       though I don't want to trip on anything by accident. What should I do?"</p>
