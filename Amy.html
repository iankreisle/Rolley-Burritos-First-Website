        <p>Hello! This is Amy. I go by they/them, and I'm a GIMM student who love to nerd out about games and shows. I do a lot of art like this:</p>

        <p>My favorite game is Deltarune. The background for this page is a setting in the game itself.</p>

        <p>The game is about a character named Kris who you play as who discovers and gets stuck in the dark world with another character named Susie. Kris and Susie soon meet Ralsei, 
          who tells them about the prophecy of the three of them being heros, and they explore the dark world and meet wacky characters and friends. The game is an rpg and gives you 
          the option to spare enemies and befriend them, and it's interesting how much you interact with the characters and discover secret bosses as well.</p>
        <p>I really like the game because the plot is so well done and the characters have such wild and fun personalities and have so much character development.</p>

        <p>My favorite character from the game is Susie.</p>
        <img src="images/Images for Amy's Page/Susie_battle_victory.webp" alt="Susie gif" class="image-center">
        <p>The reason why I like her is because even though she's brash and rude at times, she still cares for her friends and turned around from being a bully to a hero.</p>
